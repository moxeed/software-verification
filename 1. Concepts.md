SPEC: formal specification of a software derived from requirements
CODE: a piece of text written in a programming language to satisfy requirements meet the performance needs, enforce invariants, and be available
TEST: a piece of text written in a programming language, focusing on simplicity to verify specific behaviors of CODE.


[Formal Verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification):
- abstract interpretation
- automated theorem proving
- type systems
- lightweight formal methods

tools: 
- fuzz testing: random input generation
	- [american fuzzy lop](https://github.com/google/AFL)
- symbolic execution: solving for inputs
- concolic execution: starting with an input and solving for different code path
- concrete execution: running code with an specific input
- mutation testing: injecting changes in code and check if the TEST of SPEC could kill it
- Code QL: query the code base in a functional/prolog style
